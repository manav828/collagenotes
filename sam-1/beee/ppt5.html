                       <p> Electrical energy used in our homes, offices, shops
                        factories is in the form of a.c. (alternating current).</p>
                        <p>There are 3 types of current that flows in the electrical
                            circuits.</p>
                        <p>I. Direct Current or DC<br>
                            II. Fluctuating Current<br>
                            III.Alternating Current or AC</p>
                           
                            <h3><u>1) Direct Current or DC:-</u></h3> 
• The current which always flow in one direction in a circuit is called as direct current. <br><br>
• Thus the current whose magnitude remains constant with time and flows continuously in a definite direction is called direct current. 
<img src="51.png" alt="I --> t" style="height: 50%;    transform: rotate(
    -1deg);width: 50%;">

            <h3>
                2) Fluctuating Current:-
            </h3>
<p> <li>If the current generated by devices like rectifier, it will be observed that the direction of current remains constant but the magnitude has small periodic variations with time. Such type of current is called fluctuating current. 
</li></p>
<img src="52.png" alt="I --> t" style="height: 50%;    transform: rotate(
    1deg);width: 50%;">


 <h3>
                3) Alternating Current:-
            </h3>
<p><li> The current which changes its direction and
    magnitude periodically at regular intervals of time in a circuit is called alternating current. 
</li></p>
<p><li>For alternating current or voltage the only necessary
    conditions is the periodic variation with time.</li></p>
<p><li>Some of the wave forms are shown as:</li></p>

<img src="53.png" alt="I --> t" style="height: 50%;    transform: rotate(
    1deg);width: 100%;">
            <h3>
                Advantages of AC over DC
            </h3>
<p> <li> The alternating voltage or currents can be increased or
    decreased by means of a transformer without any
    appreciable loss of energy whereas direct current is
    varied by resistance alone resulting loss of energy due to
    heating.</li>
</p>
<p><li> In AC a wide range of voltage or current is available with
    the help of transformer.</li></p>
<p><li> The generation of AC is cheaper than that of DC.</li></p>
<p><li> Line losses in AC power transmission is negligible in
    comparison to DC power transmission.</li></p>
<p><li> AC can be easily converted into DC by rectifier when so
    required but conversion of DC into AC is costlier.</li></p>
<p><li> AC motors are cheaper and simpler in construction.</li></p>


<h3>
    Disadvantages of Ac over DC 
</h3>
<p><li> AC is comparatively more dangerous to use during faulty insulation as it attracts a person who touches it unlike DC which gives a repelling shock.</li>
</p>
<p><li>2. For certain purpose such as electric traction, electronic circuits, electroplating, electro-refining, computers etc…, where only dc is required, ac can not be used directly. </li>

                            When θ varies from 0 to 180, the

                            Electrical resistivity (also called specific electrical resistance or volume resistivity)
                            and its inverse, electrical conductivity, is a fundamental property of a material that
                            quantifies how strongly it resists or conducts electric current.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter ρ (rho). The SI unit of
                            electrical resistivity is the ohm-meter (Ω⋅m).

                         <p>
                            The resistance of an object depends in large part on the
                            material it is made of. Objects made of electrical
                            insulators like rubber tend to have very high resistance
                            and low conductivity, while objects made of electrical
                            conductors like metals tend to have very low resistance
                            and high conductivity.

                         <p>
                            The resistance of an object also depends on the size and
                            shape of an object because these properties are extensive
                            rather than intensive. For example, a wire's resistance is
                            higher if it is long and thin, and lower if it is short and
                            thick.
