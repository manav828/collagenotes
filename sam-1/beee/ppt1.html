                <h2>Current</h2>
            </div>

            <p> An electric current is a stream of charged
                particles, such as electrons or ions, moving
                through an electrical conductor or space.</p>
            <p>It is measured as the net rate of flow of electric
                charge past a region.</p>
            <p>The SI unit of electric current is the ampere, or
                amp, which is the flow of electric charge across a
                surface at the rate of one coulomb per second.</p>
            <p>Current can be measured using an ammeter.</p>
            <p>For a steady flow of charge through a surface, the
                current I (in amperes) can be calculated with the
                following equation:<br><br>
                <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I=Q/t</b>
            </p>
            <p>where Q is the electric charge transferred through the
                surface over a time t. If Q and t are measured in
                coulombs and seconds respectively, I is in amperes.</p>
            <p>More generally, electric current can be represented as
                the rate at which charge flows through a given surface as:</p>

                <h2>Voltage</h2>
            </div>

            <p> Voltage, electric potential difference, electric
                pressure or electric tension is the difference in
                electric potential between two points, which (in a
                static electric field) is defined as the work needed
                per unit of charge to move a test charge between the
                two points.</p>
            <p>In SI units, work per unit charge is expressed as
                joules per coulomb, where 1 volt = 1 joule (of work)
                per 1 coulomb (of charge).</p>
            <p>Voltage or electric potential difference is denoted
                symbolically by V, ∆V, or U</p>
            <p>A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage (or
                potential difference) between two points in a system.</p>

            </div>

            <p> In electronics and electromagnetism, the
                electrical resistance of an object is a measure of
                its opposition to the flow of electric current.</p>

                <h2>Ohm’s Law</h2>
            </div>

            <p>Ohm’s law states that the current
                through any conductor is directly
                proportional to voltage or potential
                difference between its ends, if the
                physical conditions of the conductor
                do not change.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                I ∝ V&nbsp;
                or &nbsp;I = V/R
            </p>
            <p>Or we can state it as, V = IR.</p>
            <p>This relationship between current,
                voltage was discovered by German
                scientist Georg Simon Ohm.</p>


            <h2>Limitations of Ohm’s Law</h2>
            <p>
            <p style="color: red;">Ohm’s law is not applicable to unilateral networks.</p>

            Note:- Unilateral networks allow the current to flow in one
            direction. Such types of network consist elements like
            a diode , transistor, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
            <p style="color: red;">Ohm’s law is also not applicable to non – linear
                elements.</p>

            Note:- Non-linear elements are those which do not have
            current exactly proportional to the applied voltage that
            means the resistance value of those elements changes for
            different values of voltage and current. Examples of non –
            linear elements are the thyristor.

                The resistance of a conducting material is found to</p>
            1. be directly proportional to the length L of the material.<br>
            2. be inversely proportional to the cross- section are A of
            the material.<br>
            3. depend on the nature of the material.<br>
            4. depend upon the temperature.<br>

            <p>
                Electrical resistivity (also called specific electrical resistance or volume resistivity)
                and its inverse, electrical conductivity, is a fundamental property of a material that
                quantifies how strongly it resists or conducts electric current.
            </p>
            <p>
                Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter ρ (rho). The SI unit of
                electrical resistivity is the ohm-meter (Ω⋅m).
            </p>
            <p>
                The resistance of an object depends in large part on the
                material it is made of. Objects made of electrical
                insulators like rubber tend to have very high resistance
                and low conductivity, while objects made of electrical
                conductors like metals tend to have very low resistance
                and high conductivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The resistance of an object also depends on the size and
                shape of an object because these properties are extensive
                rather than intensive. For example, a wire's resistance is
                higher if it is long and thin, and lower if it is short and
                thick.

            <p> Resistance of almost all the materials changes with the change in the temperature. </p>
            <p>
                Then the change in resistance
                is found to be
                I. directly proportional to its initial resistance, and
                II. directly proportional to the change in temperature.

            <p>
                The variation of resistance with change in temperature of any material is governed by this property.

                Temperature co-efficient of resistance α is defined as the change in resistance per unit rise in
                temperature per ohm original resistance.

            </p>
            <p>
                Usually temperature co-efficient is taken at a particular reference temperature which is normally taken
